Que 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
Ans 1: JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. Initially created to add interactivity to web pages, it has evolved into a multi-purpose language employed for both front-end and back-end development.

Que 2:2: Explain the key differences between JavaScript and HTML. Provide examples of situations where
you would use each.
Ans 2:
JavaScript: Use JavaScript when you need to add interactivity, manipulate page elements, handle user actions, perform asynchronous tasks like fetching data, or implement complex functionalities.

HTML: Use HTML to structure the content of a web page, define its elements, and specify the presentation of content through basic formatting, headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc. HTML provides the foundation upon which JavaScript (and CSS) builds interactive and visually appealing web experiences.

examples:
HTML
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph with <a href="#">a link</a> and an <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image">.</p>

JavaScript
function validateForm() {
    let email = document.getElementById('email').value;
    if (email === '') {
        alert('Email must be filled out');
        return false;
    }
}

Que 3: List and describe the five primitive data types in JavaScript.
Ans 3: 
Number:
Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
Example: let num = 10;

String:
Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
Example: let str = 'Hello, world!';

Boolean:
Represents a logical entity, true or false.
Used in conditional statements and logical operations.
Example: let isTrue = true;

Undefined:
Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Variables that are declared without initialization automatically have the value undefined.
Example: let variableWithoutValue;

Null:
Represents the intentional absence of any value or an empty value.
It is explicitly assigned to a variable to indicate no value.
Example: let noValue = null;

Que 4: What is the purpose of declaring variables in JavaScript, and how do you declare them using the
'let' keyword?
Ans 4:Readability and Understandability: Descriptive variable names make code more readable and understandable for other developers (including your future self). When someone reads the code, clear variable names convey the purpose or intent of the variable, reducing the need for additional comments or guesswork.

Maintainability: Well-named variables ease the maintenance process. When revisiting or modifying code, descriptive names help quickly grasp the role and function of variables, reducing the chances of introducing bugs while making changes.

Collaboration: When working in a team, descriptive variable names enhance collaboration by making it easier for team members to comprehend each other's code. It reduces the time required for others to understand and work with the codebase.

Documentation and Self-Explanatory Code: Good variable naming serves as a form of self-documentation. It eliminates the need for excessive comments to explain the purpose of variables, making the code more self-explanatory.7

Que 5:Explain the importance of comments in JavaScript and provide examples of single-line and
multi-line comments.
Ans 5:Comments in JavaScript play a crucial role in code documentation, aiding developers in understanding the purpose, functionality, and logic behind the code. They serve several important purposes:

Explanation: Comments provide context and explanations about why certain code blocks, functions, or specific lines of code are written in a particular way. They clarify the intent of the code for developers reading it.

Documentation: Comments document important information about variables, functions, algorithms, or complex logic. They help in understanding the codebase, especially when working collaboratively or when revisiting code after some time.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: Comments can temporarily disable or isolate sections of code during debugging, making it easier to identify issues without deleting the code itself.

Que 6: Explain the importance of choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript.
Provide an example where using a clear identifier improves code readability.
Ans 6:Readability and Understandability: Descriptive variable names significantly enhance code readability. When someone else reads your code or when you revisit it after some time, clear variable names convey the purpose or intent of the variable, reducing confusion and making the code easier to understand.

Maintainability: Well-named variables make code maintenance more manageable. They allow developers to quickly grasp the role and function of variables, reducing the chances of introducing bugs while making changes or additions to the codebase.

Self-Explanatory Code: Meaningful variable names serve as a form of self-documentation. They eliminate the need for excessive comments to explain the purpose of variables, making the code more self-explanatory and reducing clutter.

Collaboration: When working in a team, descriptive variable names facilitate collaboration by making it easier for team members to comprehend each other's code. It saves time and reduces the potential for misinterpretation.
